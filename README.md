Zenith App

Project Description:
My second pet project, Zenith, is an app representing objects of Solar system to user and some information about them. App has some cool features such as: Augmented Reality view Solar system objects, daily push notifications with facts about Solar system, achievements feature, settings and ability to see Wikipedia page of each object.

This app demonstrates my knowledge of:

- Using UITableView and UICollectionView
- MVC Design pattern
- Storing data using UserDefaults
- Using Scenekit
- Integrating Push notificationsÂ 
- Using Cocoapods (Firebase)
- Git and Version Control
